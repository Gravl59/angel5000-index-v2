# Angel5000 Eligibility Verification Email Template

**Subject:** Confirm Your Eligibility for the Angel5000 Index

---

Hi [Founder],

Thanks for joining the Angel5000 Universe.
We're now beginning the eligibility verification for companies that will be included in the randomized pool for the index.

This step takes about 2 minutes and confirms three things:

1. **Your company is real**
   (EIN or equivalent registration)

2. **Your online presence is legitimate**
   (website or LinkedIn + domain match)

3. **You are a real founder**
   (simple identity check, no documents)

**No scoring. No judgment. No pitch.**
Just a neutral legitimacy check before randomized sampling.

Click below to complete verification:

**[Verify Eligibility (2 minutes)]**
Link: `https://yourdomain.com/eligibility?universe_id={UNIVERSE_ID}`

Once done, you'll be part of the eligible Universe that the Angel5000 Index is drawn from.

Thanks again for being an early participant.
We're excited to build the first neutral index for early-stage innovation.

Best,
The Angel5000 Team
